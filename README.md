##README

FreeFood4Terp is an online platform which stores and displays events held by various organizations across the University of Maryland (UMD) campus. These events are held by both school and student-run organizations who are constantly giving out free food in order to promote their cause or to attract attention to their organization.

This website allows its users, primarily students at UMD, to browse and be notified of events offering free food being distributed to the nearby campus community. This will allow our users have priority to the food and/or receive a promotional discount that might otherwise go to waste.

Event organizers have the ability to submit events that they are hosting, or have been informed about, to be displayed on the website through a brief form located at the bottom of the home page.

Finally, our website gives users the opportunity to allow the platform to track their current location. This feature will assist the user in determining an eventâ€™s distance relative to theirs, allowing them to budget their time accordingly.
