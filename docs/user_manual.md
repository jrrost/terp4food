Welcome to FreeFood4Terp. The goal of this application is to connect UMD students to companies/organizationâ€™s events on campus whom are providing free food.

FreeFood4Terp is designed to have a simple and easily understandable user interface for both students and organizations using the application. The home screen displays our logo at the top of the page which clearly distinguishes our sites from others people may use.

Below our logo is our application's search box. This search box allows user to search throughout our website for features, events, companies, organizations, dates, and more. This search function is available on all pages of the website for ease of navigation.

Under both the application logo and search bar the  name and description of each event occurring that day is listed. This is an aggregated list of the events which get updated hourly to get rid of events that have expired and display new events occurring soon. Users can click on these events to find out more the event.

Upon clicking on an event hyperlink, it takes the user to another page which displays the name of the event, description, host of the event, any promo codes needed for the event, and most importantly, the location of the event.

On the right of the Today's Events the monthly calendar is displayed. The calendar is an easy way to see what events are planned for that week and month. Users can click on any date or select it from the drop down menu. Upon clicking on a date this will display the events on the date selected. From this page users can click on the link to the event to read detailed information about the event.

Below the list of "todays events," the map of the UMD campus is displayed where users can find nearby events on campus happening soon. This map helps user find events nearby but will also assist user in navigating our large campus to find the location of an event or promotion.

At the bottom of the page, there is an event submission page where companies, organizations, or any users can submit an ongoing or upcoming event. To submit an event you do not have to be affiliated with the event but it will be sent to system administrators for verification and submission.
